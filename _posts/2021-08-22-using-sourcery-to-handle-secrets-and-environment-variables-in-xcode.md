<h2>‚ÅâÔ∏è The Problem</h2>
<hr/>

<p>Environment Variables (or Project Secrets) are present in the vast majority of software projects. Whether they be <strong>API Keys, Passwords, Tokens</strong> or other sensitive information; they should <strong>never</strong> be pushed to an unencrypted remote repository. That being said, all too often, this is not the case and sensitive information finds its way into unencrypted repos. üò¨</p>

<p>This is a big problem, particularly when we start to think about CI/CD pipelines too. ü§î However, fear not! In this blog post, we'll look at this problem in an Xcode specific context and how we can avoid sensitive information being checked into source control.</p>

<h2>‚úÖ The Solution</h2>
<hr/>

Our goal here is to pass the environment variables into our project at build time; and then for our build process to generate a `.swift` file containing our secrets that can be used within the codebase. The solution has 3 main steps; <strong>Bash Script</strong>, <strong>Xcode Injection</strong> and <strong>Swift codegen</strong>. Lets look at each step in turn.

<h4>1. üî® Bash Script</h4>
<hr/>
First let's create a file named `env-vars.sh` which contains the environment variables we need to use in our project. For example:
<div class="spacer-code-block"/>
```
export EXAMPLE_API_KEY=ABCDEF123456
export EXAMPLE_PASSWORD=PASSWORD
```

<p class="figure"><i>Example env-vars file.</i></p>

We'll add this into the root directory of our Xcode project and also add it to our `.gitignore` to avoid the file being committed to source control.

<h4>2. üíâ Xcode Injection</h4>
<hr/>
Once we've created our `env-vars.sh` file, we need to make these variables available to Xcode and our Swift code. To do this, we'll use a combination of build run scripts and a Swift codegen tool called <a href="https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery">Sourcery</a>.

First, lets install Sourcery via CocoaPods. To do this, add `pod 'Sourcery'` to your `Podfile` before running `pod install` to install the dependency. Once installed, we'll head into Xcode and open the 'Build Phases' tab within our example app target. Here we'll create a new 'Run Script' that will run each time our target builds.

(<strong>Note:</strong> This script must be added before the 'Compile Sources' script for reasons we'll come to).

<p class="figure"><i>Adding a new run script into Build Phases</i></p>

Below is the script used. Each time a new variable is added to our `env-vars.sh` file; the script will need to be updated to parse out the variable.
<div class="spacer-code-block"/>
```
if [ -f ./env-vars.sh ]
then
source ./env-vars.sh
fi

${PODS_ROOT}/Sourcery/bin/sourcery --templates ./Swift-Music/Helpers/ --output ./Swift-Music/Helpers/ --sources ./Swift-Music/ --args example_api_key=$EXAMPLE_API_KEY,example_password=$EXAMPLE_PASSWORD
```

<p class="figure"><i>Example run script.</i></p>

In a nutshell, the script will source our `env-vars.sh` file, parse out each environment variable before using Sourcery to do its magic and generate our Swift secrets file ‚ú®.

<h4>3. üíª Swift codegen</h4>
<hr/>
You'll notice our run script makes reference to a `--templates` argument. This directory requires a `.stencil` template file to be present which Sourcery will use to generate our `.swift` file containing our environment variables. We'll create and name this file `APIConfig.stencil` so that `APIConfig.generated.swift` is generated.

<div class="spacer-code-block"/>
{% raw %}
```
//
//  APIConfig.swift
//  Swift-Music
//
//  Created by James Shaw on 21/08/2021.

//

import Foundation
import UIKit

public struct APIConfig {
  static let apiKey = "{{ argument.example_api_key }}"
  static let password = "{{ argument.example_password }}"
}
```
{% endraw %}
<p class="figure"><i>Example APIConfig.stencil file.</i></p>

Now, build the project (‚åò+B) once so that our `APIConfig.generated.swift` file gets generated like the example below. üöÄ

<div class="spacer-code-block"/>
```
// Generated using Sourcery 0.15.0 ‚Äî https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery
// DO NOT EDIT

//
//  APIConfig.swift
//  Swift-Music
//
//  Created by James Shaw on 21/08/2021.
//  Copyright ¬© 2021 James Shaw. All rights reserved.
//

import Foundation
import UIKit

struct APIConfig {
  static let apiKey = "ABCDEF123456"
  static let password = "PASSWORD"
}
```
<p class="figure"><i>Example APIConfig.generated.swift file.</i></p>

Sourcery will add the generated file into the directory passed as the `--output` argument in our build script. Once we drag the file from Finder into our Xcode project, we'll be able to access the variables from inside our source code. üéâ

<div class="spacer-code-block"/>
```
...
let client = APIClient(key: APIConfig.apiKey)
...
```
<div class="spacer-code-block"/>

Now given this file contains all our secrets, we'll need to make sure it's added to our `.gitignore` too. The file will also need to be added to the 'Compile Sources' and this is the reason why our build script needs to run first. üëçüèª

<div class="spacer-code-block"/>
<strong>PS: Please do make sure your `.generated.swift` and `env-vars.sh` files get added to your `.gitignore` so your secrets don't accidentally end up in your repo üòÖ.</strong>  

<h2>üîö Wrapping Up...</h2>
<hr/>
<p>So there we have it, a simple way to generate environment variables or project secrets in Xcode whilst keeping them out of source control. It's a really important tool and one that becomes even more powerful when building with a CI/CD pipeline. üîÅ Perhaps I'll cover this in a future blog post.</p>
